Конечно! Вот примерные ответы на каждый из вопросов в билетах. Я постарался сделать их развернутыми, но при этом достаточно краткими для запоминания, используя лексику из материалов курса. Вы можете адаптировать их под свой опыт и взгляды.

### **Card 1**
**1. What is the role of technology in defining beauty today?**
Technology, especially social media with its filters and editing tools, has a huge influence. It creates often unrealistic beauty standards, blurring the line between natural and artificial appearance. While it can promote inclusivity by showcasing diverse beauty, it often undermines it by pushing a homogenized, "perfect" look that is hard to achieve.

**2. How do people from large cities influence small towns?**
When people from cities like London move to small towns, they bring new services, businesses, and cultural trends. This can boost the local economy but also drive up prices and change the community's character. Some changes are positive (new opportunities), others disruptive (gentrification). Small towns should try to preserve their unique identity while embracing beneficial change.

**3. Why does Dave fight the banking system in 'Bank of Dave'?**
Dave decides to fight because he believes the system is unfair to ordinary people. He has a point: banks often neglect small communities. He is driven by a desire to contribute to his town and help others. Despite obstacles, his determination and community support push him to continue.

### **Card 2**
**1. Why is it hard to set boundaries with family?**
It's difficult because family members often weigh in on your choices without being asked. This "unwanted help" might seem supportive but can prevent you from expressing your real needs. Sometimes relatives miss out on the emotional context behind your decisions, which leads to misunderstandings and affects communication.

**2. Choosing a lifestyle: ambitions vs. family expectations?**
It's very important to choose a lifestyle that helps you fulfill your own ambitions. Living for others' expectations can lead to unhappiness. A lifestyle aligned with your own goals helps you come to terms with who you truly want to be and benefits your long-term well-being.

**3. The quote from 'Bank of Dave' and the cultural divide.**
This quote shows a clear cultural and social divide. London elites represent traditional power, skepticism, and perhaps snobbery. Dave and his town represent grassroots determination, community values, and being underestimated. The film shows this through scenes where London bankers dismiss Dave's idea as a joke, highlighting the clash between established institutions and local initiative.

### **Card 3**
**1. Was Dave a role model in 'Bank of Dave'?**
Yes, I believe Dave was a role model. He was influential because he engaged with a big problem (banking inequality) and fought for his community. Others in the film started to value his efforts and contribute to his cause, showing he inspired people.

**2. Do natural wonders help with stress?**
Absolutely. Being in nature, like hiking or stargazing, makes me feel calmer and more present. People choose these activities over scrolling because they offer a real break. Nature breaks should be treated as a genuine form of self-care.

**3. Is there a recipe for being an ideal parent?**
I agree there's no single recipe. We discussed styles like authoritative (balanced), authoritarian (strict), and permissive (lenient). Being a good parent – one who is caring, supportive, and adaptable – is more important than chasing an unattainable "ideal." The discussion about parenting should begin early, as we shape our personalities by understanding the world around us.

### **Card 4**
**1. Why do childhood rules seem unfair at first?**
As a kid, I hated my early bedtime. It felt unfair because my friends stayed up later. Now, as a young adult, I see it differently. That rule taught me discipline and the importance of rest, which makes sense for a healthy lifestyle.

**2. Can interest in ancient cultures be revived?**
I agree that interest can be revived. Culture is more than art; it's traditions, knowledge, and identity. The article 'Memories are crafted in wool' shows how crafts carry history. Even in the digital age, zoomers can revive these cultures by valuing authenticity and storytelling.

**3. Smartphones: a threat or a blessing for communication?**
They are both. They facilitate long-distance communication but can impede face-to-face conversation (e.g., everyone on phones at dinner). Some restaurants ban phones to protect quality time. Digital detox is a necessary treatment many need, but it's hard to accept due to our dependence on devices.

### **Card 5**
**1. Do achievements define us more than personality?**
Not necessarily. I consider "high-value" achievements to be invisible ones like resilience and creativity. For a chef like Evgeny Vikentiev, the true achievement is staying creative under pressure, not just the Michelin star. My own achievements that shape my path are the ones that build character, not just my résumé.

**2. Could we one day decipher thoughts?**
This technology could help people with locked-in syndrome communicate. But the risk of someone eavesdropping on your mind is a huge privacy violation. If people couldn't lie, professions like diplomacy, sales, or even poker would collapse first because they rely on strategy and hidden information.

**3. How to measure the success of Dave's bank beyond money?**
Besides profit, I'd include factors like community trust, fairness in lending, and improved quality of life for locals. These indicators are harder to calculate but more accurate in showing real impact. Big economies should also be judged using similar human-centred criteria.

### **Card 6**
**1. How do appearance and background affect generational treatment?**
As Benjamin Zephaniah describes in 'Young and dyslexic?', people often stereotype others based on looks or background, which can differ across generations (e.g., older generations might judge more harshly). These attitudes can damage confidence. Authoritative parenting, which is supportive but sets clear expectations, can best help a child develop the self-belief to overcome such limitations.

**2. Is the exodus from big cities likely?**
Life in big cities is becoming less attractive due to high costs, stress, and pollution. Margate, for example, has seen an influx of artists seeking cheaper living. I am ready to live closer to nature for a better quality of life, though I still appreciate the opportunities of big cities.

**3. Do you trust AI or humans with fragile information?**
AI can identify and analyze faint details in fragile texts (like burnt scrolls) better than humans. Accuracy is crucial with such artifacts. However, in a high-stakes situation, I might still rely on a human expert for their intuition and ability to interpret context.

### **Card 7**
**1. How do siblings influence each other?**
Growing up together shapes personality through shared routines. Siblings learn to be considerate and figure things out together, like solving a conflict. Supporting each other in difficult times builds a bond that affects future decisions, making them more empathetic and resilient.

**2. Is lifestyle a reflection of our inner world?**
Yes, lifestyle expresses our values. We discussed minimalists, digital nomads, and fast-paced urban lifestyles. I like the idea of a balanced, mindful lifestyle, though my current student life is more hectic. Digital nomadism is often a choice for freedom, but for some, it's a necessity in a globalized job market.

**3. Why is networking so important today?**
Networking opens doors to opportunities like internships and mentorships. It feels a bit awkward to me, but it's a skill to develop. I see it playing a crucial role in my future career for building professional relationships and discovering paths I might not find otherwise.

---

### **Card 8**
**1. Do smartphones connect or disconnect people?**
They do both. They help us stay in touch across distances but can damage real conversations (e.g., during meals). Restaurants banning phones aim to protect quality time. Taking a screen break can improve well-being, but it's difficult due to our digital dependence.

**2. How did Benjamin Zephaniah overcome prejudice?**
Stereotyping based on his appearance and dyslexia made his early career difficult, affecting his education and confidence. He triumphed due to qualities like resilience, creativity, and a strong sense of identity, becoming a multifaceted artist against all odds.

**3. Who was James Lovelock?**
James Lovelock was an influential scientist, best known for the Gaia theory, which proposes that Earth is a self-regulating system. His 'Daisyworld' model illustrated how living organisms and their environment interact to maintain stable conditions, supporting his theory's core idea.

### **Card 9**
**1. Can we trust unlimited internet information?**
Not always. I was taught to check the source's credibility, author, and evidence, and to avoid unverified sites. While the internet is helpful for research, it's also full of misinformation. In my opinion, it's both more helpful and more misleading, requiring constant critical thinking.

**2. Which aspect of heritage do you value most?**
I value stories and traditions most because they are personally meaningful, connecting me to my family's past. For example, family recipes carry history and emotion. This type of heritage helps people understand the past as a lived experience, not just facts.

**3. Has social media made networking easier or more complicated?**
It's made it both easier to connect and more complicated. There's pressure to appear relevant and successful online. Some connect for status, not genuine interest. While it creates opportunities, it also causes anxiety about personal branding and uncertainty about real connections.

### **Card 10**
**1. Does money shape success in science/culture as much as talent?**
The story of "banana-boy" shows that a young researcher's talent might go unnoticed without funding or media attention. The gap between ambition and financial reality is huge. Money can amplify success, but core ideas and talent remain the foundation.

**2. Was studying harder "back then"?**
Older generations mention long commutes and limited resources. Their stories make me feel respect for their perseverance but also a bit annoyed, as modern challenges (like information overload, mental pressure) are simply different, not easier. It's not a fair comparison.

**3. Does attractiveness guarantee success and happiness?**
No. Success is achieving your goals, happiness is inner peace, and beauty is subjective. The article shows beauty standards are shifting towards inclusivity. I support a "big-tent" idea of beauty that celebrates diversity, as true success and happiness come from within, not appearance.

### **Card 11**
**1. What shapes society more: hardships or shared goals?**
Hardships, like the extreme environment in Arbugaeva's Arctic homeland, force communities to adapt and bond. Shared goals, like Dave's community fighting for a bank, also unite people powerfully. Personally, I think shared goals are a stronger positive force because they drive proactive change.

**2. What one change would make society fairer?**
I would focus on better access to quality education for everyone. Young people would notice the change first, gaining skills for better jobs. This would have a long-term impact by breaking cycles of inequality and creating a more skilled, innovative society.

**3. Does having a role model mean losing your identity?**
No. A role model is someone you admire and learn from, not copy. Figures from our course, like Dave or Benjamin Zephaniah, can inspire aspects of my path (like perseverance). Following their example in specific ways helps you build your own unique identity, not lose it.

### **Card 12**
**1. How do students cope with academic pressure?**
I feel stressed during exam periods. Strategies that work are good time management, breaking tasks into smaller parts, asking teachers for help, and taking short breaks. For me, moderate pressure motivates, but too much makes learning harder.

**2. Why are old crafts like rug-making disappearing?**
People today often value fast, easy, and cheap products over quality and skill. Crafts like rug-making are time-consuming and don't offer quick financial returns, making them unappealing. Losing them is a consequence of our "right here, right now" instant-gratification culture.

**3. How can AI help and harm young professionals?**
AI can help with organizing workload, practicing skills, and finding opportunities. However, overusing it can weaken critical thinking, problem-solving, and writing skills. Students should set limits, using AI as a tool for support, not a replacement for the natural learning process. Balance is key.
